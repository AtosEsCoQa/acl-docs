# Run our promotional campaign

In this lab we want to run our promotional campaign in our production environment by applying a change to our configuration of the `carts` service. This service is prepared to allow to add a promotional gift (e.g., Halloween Socks, Christmas Socks, Easter Socks, ...) to a given percentage of user interactions in the `carts` service. 
Therefore, the endpoint `carts/1/items/promotional/` can take as an input a number between 0 and 100 which corresponds to the percentages of user interactions that will receive the promotional gift. E.g., `carts/1/items/promotional/5` will enable it for 5 %, while `carts/1/items/promotional/100` will enable it for 100 % of user interactions.
