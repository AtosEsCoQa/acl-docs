# Clone GitHub Repositories

In the last lab, you'll clone the GitHub repositories we've forked in lab 2 to your local environment, so you can edit those files in Visual Studio Code, or any other editor of your choice.

## Data needed
* GitHub organization
* GitHub user and password

## Steps
1. Clone all projects from the GitHub organization you've created earlier to your local machine

    ```
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/carts
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/catalogue
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/front-end
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/k8s-deploy-staging
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/k8s-deploy-production
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/orders
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/payment
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/queue-master
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/shipping
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/shipping-rabbitmq
    (local)$ git clone https://github.com/<GitHubOrganization>/user
    ```
